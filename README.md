# Hi!! I'm Malik, I like playing with shiny things.

A MSci Mathematics and Statistics graduate from Lancaster University, UK, who likes building things, especially with shiny new tech.

My Github is mostly web dev stuff, a lot of Vuejs and playing with different ways to deploy web apps, like Clojurescript, as well as some game dev bits, from gamejams I occasionally do.

If you have any questions, or want to otherwise contact me, you can reach me at kissarlim@gmail.com, and a mostly up-to-date resume can be found [here][https://github.com/mkissarli/resume].
